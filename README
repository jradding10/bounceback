Bounce Back, a Bluetooth fall detection system.


Created by Jacqueline Radding. 


The Bounce Back Fall Detection system wirelessly alerts senior center workers when a patient falls. 
Elderly patients can fall and be unable to press a fall button if they have a medical emergency. The Bounce Back is a wireless, 
Bluetooth solution that protects the elderly and alerts staff if medical attention is needed to a main computer or tablet.  
Senior centers are understaffed due to COVID-19 and need to ensure the safety of their patients with reduced contact.
